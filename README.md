Hummingbird APT – Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Overview

Welcome to the Hummingbird APT SOP guide. This document outlines the key procedures and guidelines to efficiently manage both our short-term and long-term rental units. Our property consists of eight units, with four dedicated to short-term rentals (managed on platforms like Airbnb, Booking.com, VRBO, Google Hotels, and our website) and four leased to long-term tenants (managed via RentRedi).

Introduction

At Hummingbird APT, we are committed to precision, efficiency, and excellent service. Our SOP guides our daily operations—from guest inquiries to lease management—and ensures consistency in communication, security, and overall property management. Whether you’re handling guest check-ins or managing tenant move-ins, these procedures help maintain high standards across our operations.

Short-Term Rental Procedures

For our short-term rental units (Apt 2, 3, 4, and 7):

Guest Journey:

We detail every step of the guest experience—from pre-booking inquiries to post-check-out feedback. Automated messages are scheduled for key events such as "Thanks for Booking," security deposit requests, check-in instructions (with door codes provided via the Schlage app), and reminders for reviews after check-out.

Tools & Communication:

Our operations rely on Hostaway as our Property Management System (PMS) for short-term rentals. Automated systems like Charge Automation handle ID verification and security deposits. Communication with guests is streamlined using platforms such as Airbnb Inbox, Slack, and OpenPhone.

Visual Process Flow:

The SOP includes a pictorial guide of the guest journey, integrated directly with the text to illustrate each phase (Pre-Booking, Pre-Check-In, After Check-In, Check-Out, and Post Check-Out).

Long-Term Rental Procedures

For our long-term rental units (Apt 1, 5, 6, and 8):

Tenant Management:

Long-term rentals are managed through RentRedi, covering monthly billing, tenant screening, lease agreements (signed via DocuSign), and ongoing communication. We ensure clear tenant onboarding, move-in processes, and routine maintenance protocols.

Lease & Payment:

Procedures detail tenant screening (using tools like RentSpree and Zillow), creation and renewal of lease agreements, and structured rent collection through automated alerts. Security deposits are handled carefully and refunded promptly after check-out if no damage is found.

Maintenance & Utilities:

Maintenance requests are processed through RentRedi with clear guidelines for routine repairs, emergency fixes, and responsibility for utility bills. Regular inspections ensure that property conditions meet our high standards.

Tools We Use

To support our operations, we rely on a suite of digital tools:

Hostaway:

Centralizes short-term rental management, guest communications, and booking integrations.

RentRedi:

Manages long-term rentals, including tenant screening, lease agreements, rent collection, and maintenance requests.

Charge Automation & Schlage App:

Automate security deposit processing, ID verification, and remote lock management.

Slack & OpenPhone:

Facilitate fast internal communication and guest support.

Google Sheets & Drive:

Maintain revenue tracking, records, and documentation for quick reference.

Each tool is integrated into our workflow to ensure seamless coordination and up-to-date information across all operations.

Key Operational Highlights

Guest & Tenant Communication:

We aim to respond to guest inquiries within five minutes using automated messages and proactive support via our communication platforms. This ensures a smooth and clear experience throughout their stay.

Security & Verification:

A robust verification process, including security deposits and ID checks, protects our property and maintains guest trust. Automation ensures that reminders and confirmations are timely and accurate.

Documentation & Records:

All processes, from lease agreements to maintenance requests, are documented and stored in accessible digital formats. This creates transparency and aids in efficient decision-making.

Consistency & Training:

Our SOP serves as both a daily checklist and a training resource. New team members are quickly brought up to speed with our procedures to maintain consistency across all units.

Conclusion
The Hummingbird APT SOP is designed to standardize and streamline our property management. By following these procedures, we ensure efficient operations, excellent guest and tenant experiences, and clear communication at every stage. Whether you manage short-term guest check-ins or long-term lease renewals, this SOP is your guide to maintaining our commitment to excellence.
